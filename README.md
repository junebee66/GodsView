# God's View
<!-- 1-2 sentence description of assignment. Nice to include a screenshot or .gif of the site in action. -->

On this website, you will be able to elevate your point of view on your situation to have a sneak peek of God‚Äôs overall plan for you.

The more descriptive the input is, the better the algorithm can match the user‚Äôs description of his/her/they‚Äôs situation to a Bible character‚Äôs experience. Once the user finish writing, clicking on the button ‚ÄúMatch‚Äù will start the matching function.  In order to rewrite a nw set of texts, please click on the ‚ÄúRestart‚Äù button to clear all data.

>Here, the user can see the first person view of the scenario they are in.
