                            This website serves as mental guidance for people who feel lost or frustrated at any point in life. 
                            It is hard for us to see why things happened, 
                            in the way it happens, 
                            and where it is heading or leading; 
                            however, on this website, 
                            you will be able to elevate your point of view on your situation 
                            and can have a sneak peek of God’s overall plan for you. 
                            Back when I was in a Christian school, 
                            my teachers always tell me that whatever we are going through now 
                            in our lives, there are people in Bible that already went 
                            through the same journey. You can always find yourself as 
                            one of the people/characters in the Bible. Bringing this notion 
                            to the divination website, the user can express the situation 
                            they are in right now, and the website will try to match that 
                            description piece of an experience to someone’s journey in the bible. 
                            It will show and tell you what happens to the person in the Bible 
                            and what God has said to that person. In the end, you will be able to see your point of view, 
                            God’s point of view, and scripture of what God says to both you and the person in the Bible. 
                            The intention is to have you see where you are heading and rerouting you back on the right track of God’s love.
